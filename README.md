# Advanced MIS beta documentation

This repository contains end-user documentation for beta customers who are helping us develop our [Advanced MIS capability](https://github.com/talis/census-server)
of Talis Aspire. At some point these documents will probably be transitioned to the support site.

The site is designed to read like a book which is why it emphasises white space and doesn't look like a web app. Any
styling changes that promote this ethos are welcomed.

## How it works

This is a special GitHub pages repo, powered by Jekyll. The master is build automatically by GitHub and displayed at
https://techfromsage.github.io/advanced-mis.

If you wish to make changes, create a branch and submit a pull request.

## Dev in docker (Recommended)

1. [Install docker](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)
2. ``$ sh start-dev.sh``
3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:4000/

  - The first time you run 'step 2' the docker image will take a minute or so to build before launching.  When it is ready to go you will see ``Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.``.
  - When making changes to files the tooling will auto regenerate the compiled content.  Simply reload your browser tab to see your changes.
  - Edit the ``*.md`` files only.  Other files are autogenerated by Jekyll.

## Build & run locally (Not recommended - see "Dev in docker" above for preferred route)

```
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev nodejs
git clone https://github.com/talis/advanced-mis.git
cd advanced-mis
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Now go to http://127.0.0.1:4000

If you're running on a VM, start jekyll with the command

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

so that it binds to an address your host machine can access.
